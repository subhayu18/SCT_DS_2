- Cleaned the data:
  - Dropped columns with excessive missing values
  - Removed rows with nulls to retain consistency
- Explored relationships between features and survival rate
- Visualized key patterns in the data using plots

## 📈 Visualizations
- Survival rate by gender
- Survival rate by passenger class
- Age distribution of passengers
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 📁 File List
